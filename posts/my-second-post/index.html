It’s subtle but widespread. We tell ourselves we’re meant for FAANG simply because we want it badly.\nBut here’s the truth: So does everyone else.\nThere are millions of students around the world dreaming of the same outcome.\nWanting it isn’t enough. GPA isn’t enough. Even internships aren’t enough.\nThe key has always been differentiation Gone are the days of simply 4.0’ing all your classes and having internships/full-time roles waiting for you.\nAsk yourself:\nWhat are you creating or building in public?\nAnd more importantly, what’s the value of it?\nWhy should anyone care? If you can’t answer that, then you are blending in with everyone else.\nWe live in an attention economy, and your online presence has about 5-10 seconds to catch people’s attention before they click away.\nThat includes recruiters. That includes founders. That includes the people deciding whether you’re worth taking a bet on.\nHow can you differentiate yourself from millions of other students in just 5-10 seconds?\nThat is the million dollar question.\nAnd nobody has the one-size-fits all answer.\nI used to think the game was about checking boxes. Now I know it’s about telling a story that makes the right people stop scrolling.\nAnd that takes real self-reflection. Not the fake 2am dopamine hit you get from watching a motivational TikTok.\nWhat about your lived experiences makes you an irresistible hire?\nIt’s a hard question. But if you don’t have an answer, someone else already does. And they’re miles ahead of you.\nHow bad do you want it? Odds are not in your favor.\nAs certain as the sun will rise, someone else out there wants it more than you.\nThis path isn’t easy. You’ll have to give things up.\nFree time. Social media. Fun. Comfort.\nSometimes even friends.\nThe question is: what are you willing to sacrifice in order to attain your dreams?\nThe correct answer is all of the above.\nLet me be clear: it shouldn’t be this way But it is.\nIt’s the unfortunate reality we’re living in, and the uncomfortable truth that no one speaks candidly about.\nEven after “making it”, you can be laid off in a heartbeat.\n“Reorg” is just corporate-speak for you’re replaceable.\nThe only real defense is to stay sharp. Stay hungry.\nBecome irreplaceable. Do the work others won’t.\nIt’s a marathon, not a race. A game of endurance and obsession. Every decision compounds.\nIf you’re not moving forward: you’re falling behind.\nIt’s not about overworking or burnout.\nIt’s about leaving no room for regret.\nBecause the worst feeling isn’t rejection.\nIt’s knowing deep down that you didn’t give it everything.\nThat you left something on the table.\nThat you could’ve gone harder, but didn’t.\nSome people can sleep at night without a plan.\nSome people graduate without an offer and somehow feel no urgency.\nBut if that doesn’t sit right with you, if that terrifies you…\nMaybe you’re wired for something bigger So again, take a hard look at yourself:\nHow bad do you truly want this?\nWhat are you willing to give up?\nWhat lengths are you willing to go to, in order to achieve your dreams?\nThe truth is, no one owes you sh*t, not even your dream job.\nYou have to earn it.\nAnd even after that, you have to keep earning it.\nComplacency is a disease that will slowly rob you of everything you once worked for.\nIn the words of Jay-Z: “When others go to sleep, I start working”\nSo rewire your brain. Be obsessed with progress.\nRedefine fun as momentum toward your goals.\nBecause nothing is truly impossible…\nIt’s just relative to how many laps you’re willing to run.\n","wordCount":"654","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-05-20T00:01:00-07:00","dateModified":"2025-05-20T00:01:00-07:00","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Thomas Emnetu"}],"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://thegradient.ink/posts/my-second-post/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Gradient.","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://thegradient.ink/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://thegradient.ink/ accesskey=h title="Gradient.
