<p>That includes me. At least, the version of me I used to be.</p>
<p>Allow me to elaborate.</p>
<p>There’s a weird sense of entitlement that creeps in when you’re pursuing CS, Design, or PM in college. It’s subtle but widespread. We tell ourselves we’re meant for FAANG simply because we want it badly.</p>
<p>But here’s the truth: So does everyone else.</p>
<p>There are millions of students around the world dreaming of the same outcome.</p>
<p>Wanting it isn’t enough. GPA isn’t enough. Even internships aren’t enough.</p>
<h2 id="the-key-has-always-been-differentiation">The key has always been differentiation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-key-has-always-been-differentiation">#</a></h2>
<p>Gone are the days of simply 4.0’ing all your classes and having internships/full-time roles waiting for you.</p>
<p>Ask yourself:</p>
<p>What are you creating or building in public?</p>
<p>And more importantly, what’s the value of it?</p>
<h2 id="why-should-anyone-care">Why should anyone care?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#why-should-anyone-care">#</a></h2>
<p>If you can’t answer that, then you are blending in with everyone else.</p>
<p>We live in an attention economy, and your online presence has about 5-10 seconds to catch people&rsquo;s attention before they click away.</p>
<p>That includes recruiters. That includes founders. That includes the people deciding whether you’re worth taking a bet on.</p>
<p>How can you differentiate yourself from millions of other students in just 5-10 seconds?</p>
<p>That is the million dollar question.</p>
<p>And nobody has the one-size-fits all answer.</p>
<p>I used to think the game was about checking boxes. Now I know it’s about telling a story that makes the right people stop scrolling.</p>
<p>And that takes real self-reflection. Not the fake 2am dopamine hit you get from watching a motivational TikTok.</p>
<p>What about your lived experiences makes you an irresistible hire?</p>
<p>It’s a hard question. But if you don’t have an answer, someone else already does. And they’re miles ahead of you.</p>
<h2 id="how-bad-do-you-want-it">How bad do you want it?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-bad-do-you-want-it">#</a></h2>
<p>Odds are not in your favor.</p>
<p>As certain as the sun will rise, <strong>someone else out there wants it more than you.</strong></p>
<p>This path isn’t easy. You’ll have to give things up.</p>
<p>Free time. Social media. Fun. Comfort.</p>
<p>Sometimes even friends.</p>
<p>The question is: what are you willing to sacrifice in order to attain your dreams?</p>
<p>The correct answer is all of the above.</p>
<h2 id="let-me-be-clear-it-shouldnt-be-this-way">Let me be clear: it shouldn’t be this way<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#let-me-be-clear-it-shouldnt-be-this-way">#</a></h2>
<p>But it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the unfortunate reality we’re living in, and the uncomfortable truth that no one speaks candidly about.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/13/microsoft-is-cutting-3percent-of-workers-across-the-software-company.html">Even after “making it”, you can be laid off in a heartbeat.</a></p>
<p>“Reorg” is just corporate-speak for you’re replaceable.</p>
<p>The only real defense is to stay sharp. Stay hungry.</p>
<p>Become irreplaceable. Do the work others won’t.</p>
<h2 id="its-a-marathon-not-a-race">It’s a marathon, not a race.<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#its-a-marathon-not-a-race">#</a></h2>
<p>A game of endurance and obsession. Every decision compounds.</p>
<p>If you’re not moving forward: you’re falling behind.</p>
<p>It’s not about overworking or burnout.</p>
<p>It’s about leaving no room for regret.</p>
<p>Because the worst feeling isn’t rejection.</p>
<p>It’s knowing deep down that you didn’t give it everything.</p>
<p>That you left something on the table.</p>
<p>That you could’ve gone harder, but didn’t.</p>
<p>Some people can sleep at night without a plan.</p>
<p>Some people graduate without an offer and somehow feel no urgency.</p>
<p>But if that doesn’t sit right with you, if that terrifies you&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="maybe-youre-wired-for-something-bigger">Maybe you’re wired for something bigger<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#maybe-youre-wired-for-something-bigger">#</a></h2>
<p>So again, take a hard look at yourself:</p>
<p>How bad do you truly want this?</p>
<p>What are you willing to give up?</p>
<p>What lengths are you willing to go to, in order to achieve your dreams?</p>
<p><strong>The truth is, no one owes you sh*t, not even your dream job.</strong></p>
<p>You have to earn it.</p>
<p>And even after that, you have to keep earning it.</p>
<p>Complacency is a disease that will slowly rob you of everything you once worked for.</p>
<p>In the words of Jay-Z: <em>&ldquo;When others go to sleep, I start working&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>So rewire your brain. Be obsessed with progress.</p>
<p>Redefine fun as momentum toward your goals.</p>
<p>Because nothing is truly impossible&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>It&rsquo;s just relative to how many laps you’re willing to run.</strong></p>
