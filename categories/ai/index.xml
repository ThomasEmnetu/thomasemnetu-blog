I harped on the harms, ethical shortcomings, the ways this tech could be misused or cause real damage.
I still hold those concerns.
I assure you they haven&amp;rsquo;t disappeared.
But I had a profound experience this week that shifted something fundamental in how I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about this.

Faster than any of us ever expected.
The CEO of Anthropic predicted that by the end of 2025 over 90% of all software will be written by AI.
Whether that number proves true or not, the trajectory is clear.
I don&amp;rsquo;t think enough of us in university are thinking critically about the implications of this, as it will radically disrupt our lives in the next decade, regardless of what industry or profession you are in.</description></item></channel></rss>
